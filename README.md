## üßô‚Äç‚ôÄÔ∏è Who I am

As a recent graduate of Hyria's software development program (Feb 2022), I learned the importance of self-motivation and independent work, skills that have helped me excel in my career.

I started my professional journey as a front-end developer at a small startup, where I honed my ability to work collaboratively with a team and the importance of clear communication. During this time, I sharpened my skills in TypeScript, VueJS, and BackboneJS.

After being laid off from my job as a chef in 2020, I found my true passion in coding and problem-solving. I fell in love with the whole process, from brainstorming ideas to executing them flawlessly. Now, three years later, and with a software developer certification under my belt, I'm even more passionate and driven to continue learning and growing as a developer.

When I'm not coding, you can find me traveling to new places or diving headfirst into sci-fi books, movies, and video games. I'm always up for a good adventure and love exploring new worlds, whether they're fictional or not.

Let's connect and create something amazing together

## üé® My skills

I am well-versed in frontend technologies like VueJS, ReactJS, TypeScript, HTML5, and CSS3, and I also have experience with NodeJS and ExpressJS. I have worked on projects involving NoSQL databases such as MongoDB and Firebase Firestore and have dabbled in Azure services. Building and using REST APIs or GraphQL is second nature to me.
